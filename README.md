# Casino Craps

This is a 100% in browser implementation of the popular casino game, Craps.

I used this as a project to be my introduction to programming for the web in 2013. Active development ended around October/November 2013. This project is in serious need of some TLC to clean up/polish the code and bring it up to modern standards.

This is built using vanilla JavaScript, JQuery, the HTML5 Canvas, as well as some CSS3 animations/transitions.
